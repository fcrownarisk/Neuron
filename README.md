# Neuron

first declare three module based on a sphere in a Visuable Coordinate can be regarded as a dot

A Human being has at least 860 0000 0000 neuron in everybody's head

this is a huge challeage to make great progress on the topic of producing a product called robot in infinite vector space We use iterator to generate almost endless neurons in the void space either by C language or BASIC language, But not attach components in abtriary vector spacetime,we have to notice it's true that we should not load neuron in CPU or GPU which means we need the usage of CPU and GPU are 0 % in reality world

Firstly,we need a init function such as sigmoid function

    1 / 1 + Math.exp(-1),
and it seems like the diagram of arcsin(x) to activate the whole neuron

     x^7 + a * x^3 + b * x^2 + c * x + 1 = 0
It suppose there is such a statement: a = w1, b = w2 , c = w3,So that we could activate the entire neural network by typing

    x^7 + w1 * x^3 + w2 * x^2 + w3 * x + 1 = 0
    y^7 + w1 * y^3 + w2 * y^2 + w3 * y + 1 = 0
    z^7 + w1 * z^3 + w2 * z^2 + w3 * z + 1 = 0
    -1 = e^(iÏ€)
    let e = Math.E; let PI = Math.PI;
We assume to input a simple function f(x) = w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 meanwhile,We suppose the gradle of math function of basic neuron is arccos(-1/3) = 109"28' degree Understand the principle of the chemistry matter is Alkene,it's exactly a CH4
