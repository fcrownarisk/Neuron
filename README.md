Declare three module based on a Visuable Spherecial Coordinate can be regarded as a dot .

WE attach a init function such as sigmoid method
    1 / 1 + Math.exp(-1)
and it seems like the diagram of arcsin(x)
To activate the whole neuron 

    x^7 + a * x^3 + b * x^2 + c * x + 1 = 0

WE suppose to be a statement: a = w1, b = w2 , c = w3

So that we could activate the entire neural network by typing

    x^7 + w1 * x^3 + w2 * x^2 + w3 * x + 1 = 0
    y^7 + w1 * y^3 + w2 * y^2 + w3 * y + 1 = 0
    z^7 + w1 * z^3 + w2 * z^2 + w3 * z + 1 = 0
    
    -1 = e^(iÏ€)
    
    let e = Math.E; let PI = Math.PI;
    
We assume to input a simple function f(x) = w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 

meanwhile,We suppose the gradle of math function of basic neuron is  arccos(-1/3) = 109"28'

Understand the principle of this chemistry matter is a CH4
